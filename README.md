# context-aware-response-manager
This proposed context-aware response manager is designed to serve as a virtual companion for verbally challenged children, particularly during their leisure time. It aims to address the loneliness and isolation often experienced by this population by providing a friendly and engaging conversational partner.

The system's ability to adapt its responses to the user's context makes it a valuable tool for promoting emotional resilience and fostering a sense of connection. By providing a supportive and understanding companion, the system can help children navigate the challenges of social isolation and loneliness.
The proposed context-aware response manager has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for verbally challenged children, providing them with a much-needed source of companionship and support.
